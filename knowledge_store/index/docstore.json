There is large consent that successful training of deep net-\nworks requires many thousand annotated training samples. In this pa-\nper, we present a network and training strategy that relies on the strong\nuse of data augmentation to use the available annotated samples more\ne\ufb03ciently. The architecture consists of a contracting path to capture\ncontext and a symmetric expanding path that enables precise localiza-\ntion. We show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from very\nfew images and outperforms the prior best method (a sliding-window\nconvolutional network) on the ISBI challenge for segmentation of neu-\nronal structures in electron microscopic stacks. Using the same net-\nwork trained on transmitted light microscopy images (phase contrast\nand DIC) we won the ISBI cell tracking challenge 2015 in these cate-\ngories by a large margin. Moreover, the network is fast. Segmentation\nof a 512x512 image takes less than a second on a recent GPU. The full\nimplementation (based on Ca\ufb00e) and the trained networks are available\nat http://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/people/ronneber/u-net.\n1 Introduction\nIn the last two years, deep convolutional networks have outperformed the state of\nthe art in many visual recognition tasks, e.g. [7,3]. While convolutional networks\nhave already existed for a long time [8], their success was limited due to the\nsize of the available training sets and the size of the considered networks. The\nbreakthrough by Krizhevsky et al. [7] was due to supervised training of a large\nnetwork with 8 layers and millions of parameters on the ImageNet dataset with\n1 million training images. Since then, even larger and deeper networks have been\ntrained [12].\nThe typical use of convolutional networks is on classi\ufb01cation tasks, where\nthe output to an image is a single class label. However, in many visual tasks,\nespecially in biomedical image processing, the desired output should include\nlocalization, i.e., a class label is supposed to be assigned to each pixel. More-\nover, thousands of training images are usually beyond reach in biomedical tasks.\nHence, Ciresan et al. [1] trained a network in a sliding-window setup to predict\nthe class label of each pixel by providing a local region (patch) around that pixelarXiv:1505.04597v1  [cs.CV]  18 May 2015", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f894a7a6-99d0-4bd1-a3dc-eee357cc4cd2": {"__data__": {"id_": "f894a7a6-99d0-4bd1-a3dc-eee357cc4cd2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "unet.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "db8faed9-ecfc-45ac-8594-7b03fccafa89", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "unet.pdf"}, "hash": "70a99638312de3bbef68379b6bb019f3881fe493341b912aad20672d23c4089d"}}, "hash": "70a99638312de3bbef68379b6bb019f3881fe493341b912aad20672d23c4089d", "text": "2\ncopy and cropinput\nimage\ntileoutput \nsegmentation \nmap641\n128\n256\n512\n1024max pool 2x2\nup-conv 2x2conv 3x3, ReLU572 x 572\n284\u00b264\n128\n256\n512570 x 570\n568 x 568\n282\u00b2\n280\u00b2140\u00b2\n138\u00b2\n136\u00b268\u00b2\n66\u00b2\n64\u00b232\u00b2\n28\u00b256\u00b2\n54\u00b2\n52\u00b2512\n104\u00b2\n102\u00b2\n100\u00b2200\u00b230\u00b2\n198\u00b2\n196\u00b2392 x 392\n390 x 390\n388 x 388\n388 x 388\n102451225625612864128642\nconv 1x1\nFig. 1.

Secondly, the training data in terms\nof patches is much larger than the number of training images. The resulting\nnetwork won the EM segmentation challenge at ISBI 2012 by a large margin.\nObviously, the strategy in Ciresan et al. [1] has two drawbacks. First, it\nis quite slow because the network must be run separately for each patch, and\nthere is a lot of redundancy due to overlapping patches. Secondly, there is a\ntrade-o\ufb00 between localization accuracy and the use of context. Larger patches\nrequire more max-pooling layers that reduce the localization accuracy, while\nsmall patches allow the network to see only little context. More recent approaches\n[11,4] proposed a classi\ufb01er output that takes into account the features from\nmultiple layers. Good localization and the use of context are possible at the\nsame time.\nIn this paper, we build upon a more elegant architecture, the so-called \u201cfully\nconvolutional network\u201d [9]. We modify and extend this architecture such that it\nworks with very few training images and yields more precise segmentations; see\nFigure 1. The main idea in [9] is to supplement a usual contracting network by\nsuccessive layers, where pooling operators are replaced by upsampling operators.\nHence, these layers increase the resolution of the output.

Overlap-tile strategy for seamless segmentation of arbitrary large images (here\nsegmentation of neuronal structures in EM stacks). Prediction of the segmentation in\nthe yellow area, requires image data within the blue area as input. Missing input data\nis extrapolated by mirroring\noutput. A successive convolution layer can then learn to assemble a more precise\noutput based on this information.\nOne important modi\ufb01cation in our architecture is that in the upsampling\npart we have also a large number of feature channels, which allow the network\nto propagate context information to higher resolution layers. As a consequence,\nthe expansive path is more or less symmetric to the contracting path, and yields\na u-shaped architecture. The network does not have any fully connected layers\nand only uses the valid part of each convolution, i.e., the segmentation map only\ncontains the pixels, for which the full context is available in the input image.\nThis strategy allows the seamless segmentation of arbitrarily large images by an\noverlap-tile strategy (see Figure 2). To predict the pixels in the border region\nof the image, the missing context is extrapolated by mirroring the input image.\nThis tiling strategy is important to apply the network to large images, since\notherwise the resolution would be limited by the GPU memory.\nAs for our tasks there is very little training data available, we use excessive\ndata augmentation by applying elastic deformations to the available training im-\nages. This allows the network to learn invariance to such deformations, without\nthe need to see these transformations in the annotated image corpus. This is\nparticularly important in biomedical segmentation, since deformation used to\nbe the most common variation in tissue and realistic deformations can be simu-\nlated e\ufb03ciently. The value of data augmentation for learning invariance has been\nshown in Dosovitskiy et al. [2] in the scope of unsupervised feature learning.\nAnother challenge in many cell segmentation tasks is the separation of touch-\ning objects of the same class; see Figure 3. To this end, we propose the use of\na weighted loss, where the separating background labels between touching cells\nobtain a large weight in the loss function.\nThe resulting network is applicable to various biomedical segmentation prob-\nlems.

[1]. Furthermore, we show results for\ncell segmentation in light microscopy images from the ISBI cell tracking chal-\nlenge 2015. Here we won with a large margin on the two most challenging 2D\ntransmitted light datasets.\n2 Network Architecture\nThe network architecture is illustrated in Figure 1. It consists of a contracting\npath (left side) and an expansive path (right side). The contracting path follows\nthe typical architecture of a convolutional network. It consists of the repeated\napplication of two 3x3 convolutions (unpadded convolutions), each followed by\na recti\ufb01ed linear unit (ReLU) and a 2x2 max pooling operation with stride 2\nfor downsampling. At each downsampling step we double the number of feature\nchannels. Every step in the expansive path consists of an upsampling of the\nfeature map followed by a 2x2 convolution (\u201cup-convolution\u201d) that halves the\nnumber of feature channels, a concatenation with the correspondingly cropped\nfeature map from the contracting path, and two 3x3 convolutions, each fol-\nlowed by a ReLU. The cropping is necessary due to the loss of border pixels in\nevery convolution. At the \ufb01nal layer a 1x1 convolution is used to map each 64-\ncomponent feature vector to the desired number of classes. In total the network\nhas 23 convolutional layers.\nTo allow a seamless tiling of the output segmentation map (see Figure 2), it\nis important to select the input tile size such that all 2x2 max-pooling operations\nare applied to a layer with an even x- and y-size.\n3 Training\nThe input images and their corresponding segmentation maps are used to train\nthe network with the stochastic gradient descent implementation of Ca\ufb00e [6].\nDue to the unpadded convolutions, the output image is smaller than the input\nby a constant border width. To minimize the overhead and make maximum use\nof the GPU memory, we favor large input tiles over a large batch size and hence\nreduce the batch to a single image. Accordingly we use a high momentum (0.99)\nsuch that a large number of the previously seen training samples determine the\nupdate in the current optimization step.\nThe energy function is computed by a pixel-wise soft-max over the \ufb01nal\nfeature map combined with the cross entropy loss function.

The evaluation is done\nby thresholding the map at 10 di\ufb00erent levels and computation of the \u201cwarping\nerror\u201d, the \u201cRand error\u201d and the \u201cpixel error\u201d [14].\nThe u-net (averaged over 7 rotated versions of the input data) achieves with-\nout any further pre- or postprocessing a warping error of 0.0003529 (the new\nbest score, see Table 1) and a rand-error of 0.0382.\nThis is signi\ufb01cantly better than the sliding-window convolutional network\nresult by Ciresan et al. [1], whose best submission had a warping error of 0.000420\nand a rand error of 0.0504. In terms of rand error the only better performing\nTable 1.
